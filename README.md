===========

A collaborative text editor implementing 
Neil Fraser's 
[differential synchronization algorithm](https://neil.fraser.name/writing/sync/)
as a `Python` server with a `JS` client. The implementation is functionally
complete, but does not address all the network failure scenarios considered
by Fraser. A caveat is in order: The project was conceived as an 
experiment in using coroutines/continuations in Python. I haven't had 
a chance to clean or tighten up the code since.
